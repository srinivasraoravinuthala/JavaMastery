## Detailed Questions

### 1. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
- **Short:** JVM runs bytecode; JRE = JVM + libraries; JDK = JRE + dev tools.
- **Detailed:** The **JVM** is the abstract machine that loads/verifies/executes `.class` bytecode and manages memory/GC. The **JRE** packages the JVM with the standard class library so you can *run* programs. The **JDK** adds development tools (`javac`, `jar`, `javadoc`, `jshell`) so you can *build* programs.
- **Example:** `javac App.java` (JDK) produces `App.class`, which `java App` (JRE/JVM) executes.

### 2. Why is Java "platform independent"?
- **Short:** Compiles to bytecode that any JVM can run.
- **Detailed:** Source compiles once to platform-neutral bytecode; each OS has its own JVM that interprets/JITs that bytecode. "Write once, run anywhere." The JVM itself is platform-dependent.
- **Example:** The same `App.class` runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS JVMs.

### 3. `==` vs `.equals()`?
- **Short:** `==` compares references/primitives; `equals` compares logical value.
- **Detailed:** For objects `==` checks identity (same reference). `equals` is overridable for value equality; if you override `equals` you must override `hashCode`. Watch the Integer cache (-128..127).
- **Example:** `new String("a") == new String("a")` is `false`, but `.equals` is `true`.

### 4. What is the contract between `equals` and `hashCode`?
- **Short:** Equal objects must have equal hash codes.
- **Detailed:** If `a.equals(b)` then `a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()`. The reverse is not required (collisions allowed). Breaking this corrupts hash-based collections (`HashMap`, `HashSet`).
- **Example:** Use `Objects.hash(field1, field2)` consistently with the fields used in `equals`.

### 5. Why are Strings immutable?
- **Short:** Safety, caching (string pool), thread-safety, and hashcode caching.
- **Detailed:** Immutability allows the string pool to share literals safely, makes Strings safe to use as map keys, enables hashcode caching, and avoids accidental mutation across references (security: file paths, class loading).
- **Example:** `s.toUpperCase()` returns a new String; `s` is unchanged.

### 6. `String` vs `StringBuilder` vs `StringBuffer`?
- **Short:** String immutable; StringBuilder mutable (not thread-safe, fast); StringBuffer mutable (synchronized).
- **Detailed:** Concatenating Strings in a loop creates many objects (O(n²)). Use `StringBuilder` for single-threaded building, `StringBuffer` only if multiple threads mutate the same buffer.
- **Example:** `StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder(); for(...) sb.append(x);`

### 7. What is autoboxing and a common pitfall?
- **Short:** Auto conversion primitive↔wrapper; pitfall is the Integer cache and NPE on unboxing null.
- **Detailed:** `Integer i = 5;` boxes; `int j = i;` unboxes. Unboxing a `null` Integer throws NPE. `==` on Integers compares references except cached -128..127.
- **Example:** `Integer a=1000,b=1000; a==b` is `false`; use `a.equals(b)`.

### 8. Checked vs unchecked exceptions?
- **Short:** Checked must be declared/handled; unchecked (RuntimeException) need not be.
- **Detailed:** Checked = recoverable conditions the caller should handle (`IOException`). Unchecked = programming errors (`NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException`). `Error` (e.g. `OutOfMemoryError`) should not be caught.
- **Example:** `void read() throws IOException` (checked); `list.get(99)` throws unchecked `IndexOutOfBounds`.

### 8b. final vs finally vs finalize?
- **Short:** `final` = constant/non-overridable; `finally` = always-run block; `finalize` = deprecated GC hook.
- **Detailed:** `final` applies to variables (constant), methods (no override), classes (no subclass). `finally` runs after try/catch for cleanup. `finalize()` was called before GC—unreliable and removed/deprecated; use try-with-resources or `Cleaner`.
- **Example:** `try{...}finally{conn.close();}`

### 9. Overloading vs overriding?
- **Short:** Overloading = same name, different params (compile-time); overriding = redefine inherited method (runtime).
- **Detailed:** Overloading is resolved statically by argument types. Overriding uses dynamic dispatch on the runtime type; signature must match; `@Override` recommended; can't reduce visibility or broaden checked exceptions.
- **Example:** `add(int,int)` vs `add(double,double)` (overload); `Dog.sound()` overrides `Animal.sound()`.

### 10. Abstract class vs interface?
- **Short:** Abstract class = partial impl + state, single inheritance; interface = contract, multiple inheritance, default methods.
- **Detailed:** Use an abstract class for shared state/behavior and an "is-a" with common base. Use interfaces for capabilities and to allow a type to play many roles. Since Java 8 interfaces have `default`/`static`; since 9 `private` methods.
- **Example:** `abstract class Payment` (shared amount) vs `interface Comparable`.

### 11. Can you override a static method?
- **Short:** No — static methods are hidden, not overridden.
- **Detailed:** Statics belong to the class, resolved at compile time by reference type (method hiding). There's no dynamic dispatch.
- **Example:** A subclass `static m()` hides the parent's; calling via parent reference uses parent's.

### 12. What does `static` mean and when does a static block run?
- **Short:** Belongs to the class; static block runs once at class init.
- **Detailed:** Static fields/methods are shared; no instance needed. Static initializer blocks run once when the class is first actively used, top-to-bottom.
- **Example:** Caches/constants; `static { LOOKUP = build(); }`

### 13. What is the `this` and `super` keyword?
- **Short:** `this` = current object; `super` = parent.
- **Detailed:** `this.field` disambiguates; `this(...)` calls another constructor. `super.method()` calls parent's version; `super(...)` calls parent constructor (must be first statement).
- **Example:** `Dog(String n){ super(n); }`

### 14. What is a marker interface?
- **Short:** An empty interface signaling a capability.
- **Detailed:** Has no methods; used by JVM/libraries to tag classes (`Serializable`, `Cloneable`). Annotations are the modern alternative.
- **Example:** `class X implements Serializable {}`

### 15. What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?
- **Short:** `throw` raises an exception; `throws` declares possible exceptions.
- **Detailed:** `throw new X()` actually throws; `throws X` in a method signature declares that callers must handle/declare it.
- **Example:** `void f() throws IOException { throw new IOException(); }`

### 16. What are records and when to use them?
- **Short:** Immutable data carriers (Java 16+).
- **Detailed:** Generate constructor, accessors, `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString`. Implicitly final; components final. Use for DTOs, value objects, tuple-like returns. Add compact constructors to validate.
- **Example:** `record Point(int x,int y){}`

### 17. What are sealed classes?
- **Short:** Restrict which types can extend/implement (Java 17+).
- **Detailed:** `sealed ... permits A, B`. Subtypes must be `final`, `sealed`, or `non-sealed`. Enables exhaustive switches without `default`. Pairs with records for algebraic data types.
- **Example:** `sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Square {}`

### 18. What is the difference between `==` for floating point and `BigDecimal`?
- **Short:** Floating point is inexact; use `BigDecimal` for money.
- **Detailed:** `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` due to binary representation. `BigDecimal` gives exact decimal arithmetic (with scale/rounding). Never use `double` for currency.
- **Example:** `new BigDecimal("0.1").add(new BigDecimal("0.2"))` is exactly 0.3.

### 19. Pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
- **Short:** Always pass-by-value (for objects, the reference value is copied).
- **Detailed:** You can mutate the object a parameter points to, but reassigning the parameter doesn't affect the caller's variable.
- **Example:** Passing a `List` lets you `add` to it; setting `list = new ...` inside the method doesn't change the caller.

### 20. What is the diamond problem and how does Java handle default methods?
- **Short:** Conflict when two interfaces provide the same default method.
- **Detailed:** Java forces the implementing class to override and can call `Interface.super.method()` to disambiguate.
- **Example:** `class C implements A,B { public void m(){ A.super.m(); } }`

### 21. What is the difference between `Comparable` and `Comparator`?
- **Short:** `Comparable` = natural order (`compareTo`); `Comparator` = external/custom order.
- **Detailed:** Implement `Comparable` for the class's default ordering. Use `Comparator` for multiple/alternate orderings without modifying the class; compose with `comparing().thenComparing().reversed()`.
- **Example:** `list.sort(Comparator.comparing(Person::age).thenComparing(Person::name));`

### 22. What is the `transient` keyword?
- **Short:** Excludes a field from serialization.
- **Detailed:** A `transient` field is skipped during default serialization (restored as default value). Use for sensitive or derived data.
- **Example:** `private transient String password;`

### 23. What is a varargs method and a caveat?
- **Short:** `Type...` accepts 0+ args as an array; only one, last.
- **Detailed:** Internally an array; ambiguity with overloads and heap-pollution warnings with generics (`@SafeVarargs`).
- **Example:** `int sum(int... xs)`

### 24. What's the difference between `Iterator` and `ListIterator` and fail-fast?
- **Short:** `ListIterator` is bidirectional and list-only; fail-fast iterators throw `ConcurrentModificationException`.
- **Detailed:** Modifying a collection during iteration (except via the iterator) triggers `ConcurrentModificationException` in fail-fast collections. Concurrent collections are fail-safe.
- **Example:** Use `it.remove()` to delete during iteration safely.

### 25. What is the Object class and its key methods?
- **Short:** Root of all classes; `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`, `getClass`, `clone`, `wait/notify`.
- **Detailed:** Every class implicitly extends `Object`. Override `equals/hashCode/toString` for value semantics and debugging.
- **Example:** `@Override public String toString(){...}`
